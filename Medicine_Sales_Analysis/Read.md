# 📊 Project Title  
**End-to-End Pharmaceutical Sales Analytics: From Excel to Power BI**

---

## 🔄 Data Pipeline Overview

This project implements a complete ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to analyze pharmaceutical sales data and build interactive dashboards using Power BI.

1️⃣ **Extract:** Sales, customer demographics, and production cost data are gathered from Excel files and databases.  
2️⃣ **Transform:** Clean and standardize data to ensure consistency and accuracy using Power Query.  
3️⃣ **Load:** Load transformed data into a Power BI star schema data model.  
4️⃣ **Visualize:** Create interactive dashboards for sales performance, customer segmentation, compliance monitoring, and profitability.

---

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies

- **Microsoft Excel:** Source of raw sales, customer, and production data.
- **Power BI Desktop:** Visualization and business intelligence tool.
- **Power Query:** Data transformation engine in Power BI.
- **Star Schema Modeling:** Efficient data model for reporting.
