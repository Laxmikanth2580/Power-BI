This project demonstrates a full **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** pipeline, transforming raw Excel maintenance data into meaningful insights through a MySQL database and Power BI dashboards.

---

## 🔄 Data Pipeline Overview

The pipeline follows these stages:

1. **Extract**: Source data from Excel maintenance log files.
2. **Transform**: Clean and standardize data for consistency and accuracy.
3. **Load**: Insert the cleaned data into a structured MySQL database.
4. **Visualize**: Connect Power BI to MySQL and build interactive dashboards.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Microsoft Excel**: Source of raw maintenance data.
- **MySQL**: Structured relational database for data storage.
- **Power BI Desktop**: Reporting and data visualization platform.
- **Power Query**: Data transformation and cleaning tool within Power BI.
- **CorePanel UI (Optional)**: Data entry and management interface.

## 🧩 Detailed Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Extraction from Excel

- Collect Excel files containing maintenance data.
- Required fields include:
  - DAY, DATE, ENGINE, PART NAME, WORK ORDER NUM, MAIN WORK ORDER NUM, MODEL, SERIAL NUMBER, METHOD, HOURS, CATEGORY.

### 2️⃣ Data Transformation

- Standardize formats (dates, part names, methods).
- Handle missing/null values appropriately.
- Tools: Excel functions or Power Query for initial cleaning.

### 3️⃣ Load into MySQL Database

- Create database schema and tables.
- Import cleaned data into MySQL.
- Validate data integrity after load.

### 4️⃣ Connect Power BI to MySQL

- In Power BI Desktop:
  - Navigate to **Get Data > MySQL Database**.
  - Provide server and authentication details.
  - Select and import relevant tables.

### 5️⃣ Power BI Reporting

- Build dashboards with:
  - Bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, KPIs.
  - Slicers and filters for dynamic exploration.
  - DAX measures and calculated columns for advanced insights.

## 🔄 Extended Data Flow Breakdown (Full Architecture)

### 1️⃣ CorePanel UI (Frontend Interface)

- Data entry point for users to submit and manage data.
- Sends data to MySQL via backend logic.

### 2️⃣ MySQL Database

- Centralized relational data storage.
- Organized tables for users, inventory, maintenance logs, etc.
- Supports CRUD operations based on UI interactions.

### 3️⃣ Power BI (Visualization Layer)

- Connects to MySQL via ODBC or native connector.
- Supports both Import & DirectQuery modes.
- Builds interactive visualizations and dashboards for real-time reporting.

---

## ✅ Benefits of This Architecture

- 🔒 **Separation of Concerns**: UI for data input, DB for storage, BI for reporting.
- 🔄 **Real-Time Reporting**: Periodic refreshes for up-to-date insights.
- 📈 **Scalability**: New data modules can be easily integrated into the existing pipeline.
- 🔧 **Maintainability**: Clear, modular ETL design allows easy maintenance.

---

## 🛡️ Best Practices & Monitoring

- **Data Integrity**: Validate data at each pipeline stage.
- **Automation**: Automate ETL processes where feasible.
- **Security**: Protect MySQL credentials and control Power BI access.
- **Performance**: Optimize Power BI queries, especially for DirectQuery connections.
- **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive process documentation.

---

## 🚀 How to Run This Project

1. Prepare Excel maintenance data.
2. Clean and transform data using Excel or Power Query.
3. Load data into MySQL using import tools or scripts.
4. Open Power BI Desktop, connect to MySQL, and load data.
5. Build or refresh Power BI reports as required.
